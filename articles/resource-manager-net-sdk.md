# Azure Resource Manager SDK for .Net  
Azure Resource Manager SDKs are available for multiple languages and platforms. Each of these language implementations 
are available through their ecosystem package managers and GitHub.

The code in each of these SDKs is generated from [Azure RESTful API specifications](https://github.com/azure/azure-rest-api-specs). 
These specifications are open source and based on the Swagger v2 specification. The SDK code is generated code via an open source project 
called [AutoRest](https://github.com/azure/autorest). AutoRest transforms these RESTful API specifications into client libraries in multiple languages. 
If there are any aspects of the generated code in the SDKs you would like to improve, the entire set of tools to create the SDKs are open, freely available and based in widely adopted API specification format.

[Azure SDK for .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/) is provided as a set of NuGet Packages that helps you call most of the APIs exposed by Azure Resource Manager. If the SDK doesn't expose the required functionality you can easily combine the SDK with regular calls to the ARM REST API behind the scenes.

This documentation is not intended to describe all aspects of Azure SDK for .NET, Azure ARM APIs or Visual Studio, but is rather provided as a fast way for you to get started.

A full downloadable sample project from where all code snippets below have been taken, can be found [here](https://github.com/dx-ted-emea/Azure-Resource-Manager-Documentation/tree/master/ARM/SDKs/Samples/Net).

## Install NuGet packages

The examples in this topic require two NuGet packages (in addition to the Azure SDK for .NET). In Visual Studio, right-click your project and select **Manage NuGet packages**. 

1. Search for **Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory** and install the latest stable version of the package.
2. Search for **Microsoft.Azure.Management.ResourceManager** and select **Include prerelease**. Install the latest preview version (such as 1.1.2-preview).

## Authentication
Authentication for Resource Manager is handled by Azure Active Directory (AD). In order to connect to any API you first need to authenticate 
with Azure AD to receive an authentication token that you can pass on to every request. To get this token you first need to create 
what is called an Azure AD Application and a Service Principal that will be used to login with. 
For step-by-step instructions, follow one of: [Use Azure PowerShell to create an Active Directory application to access resources](resource-group-authenticate-service-principal.md), [Use Azure CLI to create an Active Directory application to access resources](resource-group-authenticate-service-principal-cli.md), or [Use portal to create Active Directory application that can access resources](resource-group-create-service-principal-portal.md).

After creating the service principal, you should have:

- Client ID or application ID (GUID)
- Client secret or password (string)
- Tenant id (GUID) or domain name (string)

### Receiving the AccessToken from code
The authentication token can easily be acquired with the below lines of code, passing in only your Azure AD Tenant ID, your Azure AD 
Application Client ID and the Azure AD Application Client Secret. Save the token for several requests since it by default is valid for 1 hour.

```csharp
private static async Task<AuthenticationResult> GetAccessTokenAsync(string tenantId, string clientId, string clientSecret)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Aquiring Access Token from Azure AD");
    AuthenticationContext authContext = new AuthenticationContext
        ("https://login.windows.net/" /* AAD URI */
            + $"{tenantId}" /* Tenant ID */);

    var credential = new ClientCredential(clientId, clientSecret);

    var token = await authContext.AcquireTokenAsync("https://management.azure.com/", credential);

    Console.WriteLine($"Token: {token.AccessToken}");
    return token;
}
```

Instead of using the tenant ID for logging in, you can use the Active Directory domain as shown below. Using this approach would require that you change the method signature to include the domain name instead of the tenant ID.

```csharp
AuthenticationContext authContext = new AuthenticationContext
    ("https://login.windows.net/" /* AAD URI */
    + $"{domain}.onmicrosoft.com");
```

You can get the access token for an Active Directory app that uses a certificate for authentication with:

```csharp
private static async Task<AuthenticationResult> GetAccessTokenFromCertAsync(string tenantId, string clientId, string certName)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Aquiring Access Token from Azure AD");
    AuthenticationContext authContext = new AuthenticationContext
        ("https://login.windows.net/" /* AAD URI */
        + $"{tenantId}" /* Tenant ID or AAD domain */);

    X509Certificate2 cert = null;
    X509Store store = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.CurrentUser);

    try
    {
        store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);
        var certCollection = store.Certificates;
        var certs = certCollection.Find(X509FindType.FindBySubjectName, certName, false);
        cert = certs[0];
    }
    finally
    {
        store.Close();
    }

    var certCredential = new ClientAssertionCertificate(clientId, cert);

    var token = await authContext.AcquireTokenAsync("https://management.azure.com/", certCredential);

    Console.WriteLine($"Token: {token.AccessToken}");
    return token;
}
```

### Querying Azure subscriptions attached to the authenticated application
One of the first things you might want to do is querying what Azure Subscriptions that are associated with the just authenticated 
application. The Subscription ID for your targeted subscription will be mandatory to pass to each API call you do from now on.

The below sample code queries Azure APIs directly using the REST API, i.e. not using any features in Azure SDK for .NET.

```csharp
async private static Task<List<string>> GetSubscriptionsAsync(string token)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Querying for subscriptions");
    const string apiVersion = "2015-01-01";

    var client = new HttpClient();
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://management.azure.com/");
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));

    var response = await client.GetAsync($"subscriptions?api-version={apiVersion}");

    var jsonResponse = response.Content.AsString();

    var subscriptionIds = new List<string>();
    dynamic json = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(jsonResponse);

    for (int i = 0; i < json.value.Count; i++)
    {
        subscriptionIds.Add(json.value[i].subscriptionId.Value);
    }

    Console.WriteLine($"Found {subscriptionIds.Count} subscription(s)");
    return subscriptionIds;
}
```

Notice that we do get a JSON response from Azure that we then extract the subscription IDs from in order to return a list of IDs. 
All the subsequent calls to Azure Resource Manager APIs in this documentation use a single Azure Subscription ID, so if your application is 
associated with several subscriptions, just pick the right one of them and pass as a parameter going forward.

From here, every call we do against the Azure APIs will use the Azure SDK for .NET so the code will look a little bit different.

### Wrapping the token as a TokenCredentials Object
All of the following API calls will need the token you received from Azure AD in the format of a "TokenCredentials" object. 
Such an object is easily created by just passing the raw token as a parameter to the class' constructor.

```csharp
var credentials = new TokenCredentials(token);
```

If you have an earlier version of the Resource Manager NuGet package (named **Microsoft.Azure.Management.Resources**), you need to use the following code:

```csharp
var credentials = new TokenCloudCredentials(subscriptionId, token.AccessToken);
```

## Creating a Resource Group
Everything in Azure is focused around the Resource Groups, so let's start by creating one. General resources and resource groups are 
handled by the *ResourceManagementClient* and as any of the following more specialized Management Clients that we will use, you need to
provide your credentials as well as a Subscription ID to identify what subscription you want to work with.

```csharp
private static async Task<ResourceGroup> CreateResourceGroupAsync(TokenCredentials credentials, string subscriptionId, string resourceGroup, string location)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Creating Resource Group {resourceGroup}");
    var resourceClient = new ResourceManagementClient(credentials) { SubscriptionId = subscriptionId };
    return await resourceClient.ResourceGroups.CreateOrUpdateAsync(resourceGroup,
        new ResourceGroup
        {
            Location = location
        });
}
```

## Creating resources manually or using templates
There are several different ways of interacting with the Azure Resource Manager APIs but the two main ways of doing it is:

* Manually, by calling specific Resource Providers manually 
or
* By using an Azure Resource Manager Template (aka. ARM Template)

Using the ARM Templates has the following benefits:

* You declaratively specify what you want the end result to look like, rather than how it should be achieved
* You don't have to manually handle parallel execution of your deployments, ARM will do that for you
* You don't have to learn C# or any other language in order to deploy an ARM Template even though you can use any language to start a templated deployment
* The domain specific language, DSL, that is used in the templates are build using JSON and is easy enough to understand by anyone that has worked with JSON

Even with all the benefits of the templates, we will start by showing you how to call the API's manually.

### Creating a Virtual Machine, piece by piece
So now we have our subscription and our resource group. If we want to deploy a Virtual Machine, we need to figure out what parts actually make up a Virtual Machine and it turns out it's quite a few parts:

* 1 or many Storage Accounts, for storing persistent disks
* 1 or many Public IP Address, PIP, for being accessible from the Internet (includes a DNS name)
* 1 or many Virtual Networks, VNET, for internal communication between your resources
* 1 or many Network Interface Cards, NIC, to allow the VM to communicate
* 1 or many Virtual Machines, VM, to run our software

Another interesting piece is also how some of these resources can be created in parallel while other ones cannot. For example:

* NICs, depend on PIP and VNet
* VMs, depend on NICs and Storage Accounts

You need to make sure you don't try to instantiate any resources before the required dependencies have been created. 
The full [sample](https://github.com/dx-ted-emea/Azure-Resource-Manager-Documentation/tree/master/ARM/SDKs/Samples/Net) provided with this documentation shows how you can efficiently create your resources in parallel while still keeping track on what's been created.

#### Creating the Storage Account
You need a storage account to store the Virtual VHDs for you Virtual Machine. If you have an existing storage account you can use it for several VMs, 
but remember to spread your load across several storage accounts not to run into limits. 
Remember that the type of Storage Account and its location can limit the VM Size you can chose since not all VM Sizes are available in all regions and/or for all storage account types.

```csharp
private static async Task<StorageAccount> CreateStorageAccountAsync(TokenCredentials credentials, string subscriptionId, string resourceGroup, string location, string storageAccountName, AccountType accountType = AccountType.StandardLRS)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Creating Storage Account");
    var storageClient = new StorageManagementClient(credentials) { SubscriptionId = subscriptionId };
    return await storageClient.StorageAccounts.CreateAsync(resourceGroup, storageAccountName,
        new StorageAccountCreateParameters
        {
            Location = location,
            AccountType = accountType,
        });
}
```

#### Creating the Public IP Address, PIP
The public IP Address is what makes your resources in Azure accessible from Internet. 
Together with the IP Address you'll also be assigned a fully qualified domain name, FQDN, that you can use for easier access.

```csharp
private static Task<PublicIPAddress> CreatePublicIPAddressAsync(TokenCredentials credentials, string subscriptionId, string resourceGroup, string location, string pipAddressName, string pipDnsName)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Creating Public IP");
    var networkClient = new NetworkManagementClient(credentials) { SubscriptionId = subscriptionId };
    var createPipTask = networkClient.PublicIPAddresses.CreateOrUpdateAsync(resourceGroup, pipAddressName,
        new PublicIPAddress
        {
            Location = location,
            DnsSettings = new PublicIPAddressDnsSettings { DomainNameLabel = pipDnsName },
            PublicIPAllocationMethod = "Dynamic" // This sample doesn't support Static IP Addresses but could be extended to do so
        });

    return createPipTask;
}
```

#### Creating the Virtual Network, VNET
Every VM created with the ARM APIs need to be part of a Virtual Network, even if the VM is alone in it. 
The virtual network must contain at least one subnet, but you can have many do divide and protect your resources in several subnets.

```csharp
private static Task<VirtualNetwork> CreateVirtualNetworkAsync(TokenCredentials credentials, string subscriptionId, string resourceGroup, string location, string vNetName, string vNetAddressPrefix, Subnet[] subnets)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Creating Virtual Network");
    var networkClient = new NetworkManagementClient(credentials) { SubscriptionId = subscriptionId };
    var createVNetTask = networkClient.VirtualNetworks.CreateOrUpdateAsync(resourceGroup, vNetName,
        new VirtualNetwork
        {
            Location = location,
            AddressSpace = new AddressSpace(new[] { vNetAddressPrefix }),
            Subnets = subnets
        });

    return createVNetTask;
}
```

#### Creating the Network Interface Card, NIC
The Network Interface Card, NIC, is what connects your VM with the Virtual Network it recides in. 
A VM can have many NICs and hence be associated with several Virtual Networks. This sample assumes you are only attaching your VMs to one VNET.

```csharp
private static Task<NetworkInterface> CreateNetworkInterfaceAsync(TokenCredentials credentials, string subscriptionId, string resourceGroup, string location, string nicName, string nicIPConfigName, PublicIPAddress pip, Subnet subnet)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Creating Network Interface");
    var networkClient = new NetworkManagementClient(credentials) { SubscriptionId = subscriptionId };
    var createNicTask = networkClient.NetworkInterfaces.CreateOrUpdateAsync(resourceGroup, nicName,
        new NetworkInterface()
        {
            Location = location,
            IpConfigurations = new[] {
                new NetworkInterfaceIPConfiguration
                {
                    Name = nicIPConfigName,
                    PrivateIPAllocationMethod = "Dynamic",
                    PublicIPAddress = pip,
                    Subnet = subnet
                }
            }
        });

    return createNicTask;
}
```

#### Creating the Virtual Machine
Finally, it's time to create the actual Virtual Machine. The VM depends directly or indirectly of all of the above created resources, 
so you need to wait for all of the above to be ready before you try to provision a VM. 
Provisioning a VM is what takes the longest time of the above resources so expect your application to be waiting a while for this to happen.

```csharp
private static async Task<VirtualMachine> CreateVirtualMachineAsync(TokenCredentials credentials, string subscriptionId, string resourceGroup, string location, string storageAccountName, string vmName, string vmSize, string vmAdminUsername, string vmAdminPassword, string vmImagePublisher, string vmImageOffer, string vmImageSku, string vmImageVersion, string vmOSDiskName, string nicId)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Creating Virtual Machine (this may take a while)");
    var computeClient = new ComputeManagementClient(credentials) { SubscriptionId = subscriptionId };
    var vm = await computeClient.VirtualMachines.CreateOrUpdateAsync(resourceGroup, vmName,
        new VirtualMachine
        {
            Location = location,
            HardwareProfile = new HardwareProfile(vmSize),
            OsProfile = new OSProfile(vmName, vmAdminUsername, vmAdminPassword),
            StorageProfile = new StorageProfile(
                new ImageReference
                {
                    Publisher = vmImagePublisher,
                    Offer = vmImageOffer,
                    Sku = vmImageSku,
                    Version = vmImageVersion
                },
                new OSDisk
                {
                    Name = vmOSDiskName,
                    Vhd = new VirtualHardDisk($"http://{storageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/{vmOSDiskName}.vhd"),
                    Caching = "ReadWrite",
                    CreateOption = "FromImage"
                }),
            NetworkProfile = new NetworkProfile(
                new[] { new NetworkInterfaceReference { Id = nicId } }),
            DiagnosticsProfile = new DiagnosticsProfile(
                new BootDiagnostics
                {
                    Enabled = true,
                    StorageUri = $"http://{storageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net"
                })
        });

    return vm;
}
```

### Using a templated deployment
Please read and follow the [Deploy Azure resources using .NET libraries and a template](./virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-csharp-template.md ) tutorial for detailed instructions on how to deploy a template.

In short deploying a template is much easier than provisioning the resources manually and the below code shows you how to do it by 
pointing at the URIs where you have the template and a parameters file. 

```csharp
private static async Task<DeploymentExtended> CreateTemplatedDeployment(TokenCredentials credentials, string subscriptionId, string resourceGroup, string templateUri, string parametersUri)
{
    var resourceClient = new ResourceManagementClient(credentials) { SubscriptionId = subscriptionId };

    return await resourceClient.Deployments.BeginCreateOrUpdateAsync(resourceGroup, "mytemplateddeployment", new Deployment(
        new DeploymentProperties()
        {
            Mode = DeploymentMode.Incremental,
            TemplateLink = new TemplateLink(templateUri),
            ParametersLink = new ParametersLink(parametersUri)
        }));

}
```
