# Azure Blob Storage: Hot and Cool Storage Tiers

## Overview

Azure Storage now offers two storage tiers for Blob storage (object storage), so that you can store your data most cost-effectively depending on how you use it. The Azure **hot storage tier** is optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently. The Azure **cool storage tier** is optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and long-lived. Data in the cool storage tier can tolerate a slightly lower availability, but still requires high durability and similar time to access and throughput characteristics as hot data. For cool data, slightly lower availability SLA and higher access costs are acceptable trade-offs for much lower storage costs.

Today, data stored in the cloud is growing at an exponential pace. To manage costs for your expanding storage needs, it's helpful to organize your data based on attributes like frequency of access and planned retention period. Data stored in the cloud can be quite different in terms of how it is generated, processed, and accessed over its lifetime. Some data is actively accessed and modified throughout its lifetime. Some data is accessed very frequently early in its lifetime, with access dropping drastically as the data ages. Some data remains idle in the cloud and is rarely, if ever, accessed once stored.

Each of these data access scenarios described above benefits from a differentiated tier of storage that is optimized for a particular access pattern. With the introduction of hot and cool storage access tiers, Azure Blob storage now addresses this need for differentiated storage tiers with separate pricing models.

## Blob storage accounts

**Blob storage accounts** are specialized storage accounts for storing your unstructured data as blobs (objects) in Azure Storage. With Blob storage accounts, you can now choose between hot and cool storage access tiers to store your less frequently accessed cool data at a lower storage cost, and store more frequently accessed hot data at a lower access cost. Blob storage accounts are similar to your existing general-purpose storage accounts and share all the great durability, availability, scalability, and performance features that you use today, including 100% API consistency for block blobs and append blobs.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Blob storage accounts support only block and append blobs, and not page blobs.

Blob storage accounts expose the **Access Tier** attribute, which allow you to specify the storage tier as **Hot** or **Cool** depending on the data stored in the account. If there is a change in the usage pattern of your data, you can also switch between these access tiers at any time.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Changing the access tier may result in additional charges. Please see the [Pricing and Billing](storage-blob-storage-tiers.md#pricing-and-billing) section for more details.

Example usage scenarios for the hot storage access tier include:

- Data that is in active use or expected to be accessed (read from and written to) frequently.
- Data that is staged for processing and eventual migration to the cool storage tier.

Example usage scenarios for the cool storage access tier include:

- Backup, archival and disaster recovery datasets.
- Older media content not viewed frequently anymore but is expected to be available immediately when accessed.
- Large data sets that need to be stored cost effectively while more data is being gathered for future processing. (*e.g.*, long-term storage of scientific data, raw telemetry data from a manufacturing facility)
- Original (raw) data that must be preserved, even after it has been processed into final usable form. (*e.g.*, Raw media files after transcoding into other formats)
- Compliance and archival data that needs to be stored for a long time and is hardly ever accessed. (*e.g.*, Security camera footage, old X-Rays/MRIs for healthcare organizations, audio recordings and transcripts of customer calls for financial services)

See [About Azure storage accounts](storage-create-storage-account.md) for more information on storage accounts.

For applications requiring only block or append blob storage, we recommend using Blob storage accounts, to take advantage of the differentiated pricing model of tiered storage. However, we understand that this might not be possible under certain circumstances where using general-purpose storage accounts would be the way to go, such as:

- You need to use tables, queues, or files and want your blobs stored in the same storage account. Note that there is no technical advantage to storing these in the same account other than having the same shared keys.
- You still need to use the Classic deployment model. Blob storage accounts are only available via the Azure Resource Manager deployment model.
- You need to use page blobs. Blob storage accounts do not support page blobs. We generally recommend using block blobs unless you have a specific need for page blobs.
- You use a version of the [Storage Services REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dd894041.aspx) that is earlier than 2014-02-14 or a client library with a version lower than 4.x, and cannot upgrade your application.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Blob storage accounts are currently supported in a majority of Azure regions with more to follow. You can find the updated list of available regions on the [Azure Services by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/#services) page.

## Pricing and Billing

Blob storage accounts use a new pricing model for blob storage based on the access tier. When using a Blob storage account, the following billing considerations apply:

- **Storage costs**: In addition to the amount of data stored, the cost of storing data varies depending on the access tier. The per-gigabyte cost is lower for the cool storage access tier than for the hot storage access tier.
- **Data access costs**: For data in the cool storage access tier, you will be charged a per-gigabyte data access charge for reads and writes.
- **Transaction costs**: There is a per-transaction charge for both tiers. However, the per-transaction cost for the cool storage access tier is higher than that for the hot storage access tier.
- **Geo-Replication data transfer costs**: This only applies to accounts with geo-replication configured, including GRS and RA-GRS. Geo-replication data transfer incurs a per-gigabyte charge.
- **Outbound data transfer costs**: Outbound data transfers (data that is transferred out of an Azure region) incur billing for bandwidth usage on a per-gigabyte basis, consistent with general-purpose storage accounts.
- **Changing the access tier**: Changing the access tier from cool to hot will incur a charge equal to reading all the data existing in the storage account for every transition. On the other hand, changing the access tier from hot to cool will be free of cost.

> [AZURE.NOTE] In order to allow users to try out the new storage tiers and validate functionality post launch, the charge for changing the access tier from cool to hot will be waived off until June 30th 2016. Starting July 1st 2016, the charge will be applied to all transitions from cool to hot. For more details on the pricing model for Blob storage accounts see, [Azure Storage Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/) page. For more details on the outbound data transfer charges see, [Data Transfers Pricing Details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/data-transfers/) page.

## Quick Start

In this section we will demonstrate the following scenarios using the Azure portal:

- How to create a Blob storage account.
- How to manage a Blob storage account.

### Using the Azure portal

#### Create a Blob storage account using the Azure portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. On the Hub menu, select **New** > **Data + Storage** > **Storage account**.

3. Enter a name for your storage account.

	This name must be globally unique; it is used as part of the URL used to access the objects in the storage account.  

4. Select **Resource Manager** as the deployment model.

	Tiered storage can only be used with Resource Manager storage accounts; this is the recommended deployment model for new resources. For more information, check out the [Azure Resource Manager overview](../resource-group-overview.md).  

5. In the Account Kind dropdown list, select **Blob Storage**. 

	This is where you select the type of storage account. Tiered storage is not available in general-purpose storage; it is only available in the Blob storage type account. 	

	Note that when you select this, the performance tier is set to Standard. Tiered storage is not available with the Premium performance tier. 

6. Select the replication option for the storage account: **LRS**, **GRS**, or **RA-GRS**. The default is **RA-GRS**. 
 
	LRS = locally redundant storage; GRS = geo-redundant storage (2 regions); RA-GRS is read-access geo-redundant storage (2 regions with read access to the second).

	For more details on Azure Storage replication options, check out [Azure Storage replication](storage-redundancy.md).

7. Select the access tier: **Cool** or **Hot**. The default is **Hot**.

8. Select the subscription in which you want to create the new storage account.

9. Specify a new resource group or select an existing resource group. For more information on resource groups, see [Using the Azure portal to manage your Azure resources](../azure-portal/resource-group-portal.md).

10. Select the region for your storage account.

11. Click **Create** to create the storage account.

#### Change the access tier on a Blob storage account using the Azure portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. To navigate to your storage account, select All Resources, then select your storage account.

3. In the Settings blade, click **Configuration** to view and/or change the account configuration.

4. Select the desired access tier: **Hot** or **Cool**.

5. Click Save at the top of the blade. 

    > [AZURE.NOTE] Changing the access tier may result in additional charges. Please see the [Pricing and Billing](storage-blob-storage-tiers.md#pricing-and-billing) section for more details.

## Migrating to Blob storage accounts

The purpose of this section is to help users to make a smooth transition to Blob storage accounts. A Blob storage account is specialized for storing only block and append blobs. Existing general-purpose storage accounts, which allow you to store tables, queues, files and disks as well as blobs, cannot be converted to Blob storage accounts. To use the storage tiers, you will need to create new Blob storage accounts and migrate your existing data into the newly created accounts.

### Planning the migration of existing data

If you are moving your data to a Blob storage account, you probably want to take advantage of the cool storage access tier to save on storage costs for less frequently used data. The first step in planning the migration of data in a Blob storage account in the cool storage access tier is to evaluate your existing usage pattern to determine whether you will benefit from migrating to a Blob storage account. In general, you will want to know:

- Your storage consumption pattern – How much data is being stored and how does this change on a monthly basis?
- Your storage access patterns – How much data is being read from and written to the account (including new data)? How many and which transactions are used for data access?

To monitor your existing storage accounts and to gather this data please see, [Enabling Azure Storage metrics and viewing metrics data](storage-enable-and-view-metrics.md). Now using this data, you can use the [Azure Storage Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/?scenario=data-management) to help estimate your costs.

### Migrating existing data

You can use the following methods to migrate existing data into Blob storage accounts from on-premise storage devices, from third-party cloud storage providers, or from your existing general-purpose storage accounts in Azure:

#### AzCopy

AzCopy is a Windows command-line utility designed for high-performance copying of data to and from Azure Storage. You can use AzCopy to copy data into your Blob storage account from your existing general-purpose storage accounts, or to upload data from your on-premises storage devices into your Blob storage account.

For more details, see [Transfer data with the AzCopy Command-Line Utility](storage-use-azcopy.md).

#### Data Movement Library

Azure Storage data movement library for .NET is based on the core data movement framework that powers AzCopy. The library is designed for high-performance, reliable and easy data transfer operations similar to AzCopy. This allows you to take full benefits of the features provided by AzCopy in your application natively without having to deal with running and monitoring external instances of AzCopy.

For more details, see [Azure Storage Data Movement Library for .Net](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-net-data-movement)

#### REST API or Client Library

You can create a custom application to migrate your data into a Blob storage account using one of the Azure client libraries or the Azure storage services REST API. Azure Storage provides rich client libraries for multiple languages and platforms like .NET, Java, C++, Node.JS, PHP, Ruby, and Python. The client libraries offer advanced capabilities such as retry logic, logging, and parallel uploads. You can also develop directly against the REST API, which can be called by any language that makes HTTP/HTTPS requests.

For more details, see [Get Started with Azure Blob storage](storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs.md).

> [AZURE.NOTE] Blobs encrypted using client-side encryption store encryption-related metadata stored with the blob. It is absolutely critical that any copy mechanism should ensure that the blob metadata, and especially the encryption-related metadata, is preserved. If you copy the blobs without this metadata, the blob content will not be retrievable again. For more details regarding encryption-related metadata, see [Azure Storage client side encryption](storage-client-side-encryption.md).

## FAQs

1. **Are existing storage accounts still available?**

    Yes, existing storage accounts are still available and are unchanged in pricing or functionality.  They do not have the ability to choose an access tier and will not have tiering capabilities in the future.

2. **Why and when should I start using Blob storage accounts?**

    Blob storage accounts are specialized for storing blobs and allow us to introduce new blob-centric features. Going forward, Blob storage accounts are the recommended way for storing blobs, as future capabilities such as hierarchical storage and tiering will be introduced based on this account type. However, it is up to you when you would like to migrate based on your business requirements.

3. **Can I convert my existing storage account to a Blob storage account?**

    No. Blob storage account is a different kind of storage account and you will need to create it new and migrate your data as explained above.

4. **Can I store objects in both access tiers in the same account?**

    The access tier attribute is set at an account level and applies to all objects in that account. You cannot set the access tier at the object level.

5. **Can I change the access tier on my Blob storage account?**

    Yes. You will be able to change the access tier on the storage account. Changing the access tier at an account level will apply to all objects stored in the account. Change the access tier from hot to cool will not incur any charges, while changing from cool to hot will incur a per GB cost for reading all the data in the account.

6. **How frequently can I change the access tier on my Blob storage account?**

    While we do not enforce a limitation on how frequently the access tier can be changed, please be aware that changing the access tier from cool to hot will incur significant charges. We do not recommend changing the access tier frequently.

7. **Will the blobs in the cool storage access tier behave differently than the ones in the hot storage access tier?**

    Blobs in the hot storage access tier have the same latency as blobs in general-purpose storage accounts. Blobs in the cool storage access tier have a similar latency (in milliseconds) as blobs in general-purpose storage accounts.

    Blobs in the cool storage access tier will have a slightly lower availability service level (SLA) than the blobs stored in the hot storage access tier. For more details, see [SLA for storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/storage).

8. **Can I store page blobs and virtual machine disks in Blob storage accounts?**

    Blob storage accounts support only block and append blobs, and not page blobs. Azure virtual machine disks are backed by page blobs and as a result Blob storage accounts cannot be used to store virtual machine disks. However it is possible to store backups of the virtual machine disks as block blobs in a Blob storage account.

9. **Will I need to change my existing applications to use Blob storage accounts?**

    Blob storage accounts are 100% API consistent with general-purpose storage accounts for block and append blobs. As long as your application is using block blobs or append blobs, and you are using the 2014-02-14 version of the [Storage Services REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dd894041.aspx) or greater then your application should just work. If you are using an older version of the protocol, then you will need to update your application to use the new version so as to work seamlessly with both types of storage accounts. In general, we always recommend using the latest version regardless of which storage account type you use.

10. **Will there be a change in user experience?**

    Blob storage accounts are very similar to a general-purpose storage accounts for storing block and append blobs, and support all the key features of Azure Storage, including high durability and availability, scalability, performance, and security. Other than the features and restrictions specific to Blob storage accounts and its access tiers that have been called out above, everything else remains the same.
