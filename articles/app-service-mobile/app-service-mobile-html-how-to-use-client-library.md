# How to Use the JavaScript Client Library for Azure Mobile Apps

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-client-library](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-client-library.md)]

This guide teaches you to perform common scenarios using the latest [JavaScript SDK for Azure Mobile Apps]. If you are new to Azure Mobile
Apps, first complete [Azure Mobile Apps Quick Start] to create a backend and create a table. In this guide, we focus on using the mobile
backend in HTML/JavaScript Web applications.

##<a name="Setup"></a>Setup and Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have created a backend with a table. This guide assumes that the table has the same schema as the tables in those
tutorials.

Installing the Azure Mobile Apps JavaScript SDK can be done via the `npm` command:

```
npm install azure-mobile-apps-client --save
```

Once installed, the library is located in `node_modules/azure-mobile-apps-client/dist/MobileServices.Web.min.js`.  Copy this file to your web area.

```
<script src="path/to/MobileServices.Web.min.js"></script>
```

The library can also be used as an ES2015 module, within CommonJS environments such as Browserify and
Webpack and as an AMD library.  For example:

```
# For ECMAScript 5.1 CommonJS
var WindowsAzure = require('azure-mobile-apps-client');
# For ES2015 modules
import * as WindowsAzure from 'azure-mobile-apps-client';
```

##<a name="auth"></a>How to: Authenticate Users

Azure App Service supports authenticating and authorizing app users using a variety of external identity
providers: Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, and Twitter.   You can set permissions on tables to restrict
access for specific operations to only authenticated users. You can also use the identity of authenticated
users to implement authorization rules in server scripts. For more information, see the [Get started with authentication] tutorial.

Two authentication flows are supported: a server flow and a client flow.  The server flow provides the simplest
authentication experience, as it relies on the provider's web authentication interface. The client flow allows for
deeper integration with device-specific capabilities such as single-sign-on as it relies on provider-specific SDKs.

##<a name="register-for-push"></a>How to: Register for Push Notifications

Install the [phonegap-plugin-push] to handle push notifications.  This can be easily added using the `cordova plugin add`
command on the command line, or via the Git plugin installer within Visual Studio.  The following code in your Apache
Cordova app will register your device for push notifications:

```
var pushOptions = {
    android: {
        senderId: '<from-gcm-console>'
    },
    ios: {
        alert: true,
        badge: true,
        sound: true
    },
    windows: {
    }
};
pushHandler = PushNotification.init(pushOptions);

pushHandler.on('registration', function (data) {
    registrationId = data.registrationId;
    // For cross-platform, you can use the device plugin to determine the device
    // Best is to use device.platform
    var name = 'gcm'; // For android - default
    if (device.platform.toLowerCase() === 'ios')
        name = 'apns';
    if (device.platform.toLowerCase().substring(0, 3) === 'win')
        name = 'wns';
    client.push.register(name, registrationId);
});

pushHandler.on('notification', function (data) {
    // data is an object and is whatever is sent by the PNS - check the format
    // for your particular PNS
});

pushHandler.on('error', function (error) {
    // Handle errors
});
```

Use the Notification Hubs SDK to send push notifications from the server.  You should never
send push notifications directly from clients as that could be used to trigger a denial of
service attack against Notification Hubs or the PNS.
