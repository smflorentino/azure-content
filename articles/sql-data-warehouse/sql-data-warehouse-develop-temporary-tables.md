# Temporary tables in SQL Data Warehouse
Temporary tables are very useful when processing data - especially during transformation where the intermediate results are transient. In SQL Data Warehouse temporary tables exist at the session level.  However, they are still defined as local temporary tables but unlike SQL Server tables they can be accessed from anywhere inside the session.

This article contains some essential guidance for using temporary tables and highlights the principles of session level temporary tables. Using this information can help you modularize your code. Code modularity is important for ease of maintenance and code re-use.

## Creating temporary tables
Creating a temporary table is very straight forward. All you need to do is simply prefix the table name with # as in the example below:

```sql
CREATE TABLE #stats_ddl
(
	[schema_name]			NVARCHAR(128) NOT NULL
,	[table_name]            NVARCHAR(128) NOT NULL
,	[stats_name]            NVARCHAR(128) NOT NULL
,	[stats_is_filtered]     BIT           NOT NULL
,	[seq_nmbr]              BIGINT        NOT NULL
,	[two_part_name]         NVARCHAR(260) NOT NULL
,	[three_part_name]       NVARCHAR(400) NOT NULL
)
WITH
(
	DISTRIBUTION = HASH([seq_nmbr])
,	HEAP
)
```

Temporary tables can also be created using `CTAS` using exactly the same approach.   

```sql
CREATE TABLE #stats_ddl
WITH
(
	DISTRIBUTION = HASH([seq_nmbr])
,	HEAP
)
AS
(
SELECT
		sm.[name]				                                                AS [schema_name]
,		tb.[name]				                                                AS [table_name]
,		st.[name]				                                                AS [stats_name]
,		st.[has_filter]			                                                AS [stats_is_filtered]
,       ROW_NUMBER()
        OVER(ORDER BY (SELECT NULL))                                            AS [seq_nmbr]
,								 QUOTENAME(sm.[name])+'.'+QUOTENAME(tb.[name])  AS [two_part_name]
,		QUOTENAME(DB_NAME())+'.'+QUOTENAME(sm.[name])+'.'+QUOTENAME(tb.[name])  AS [three_part_name]
FROM	sys.objects			AS ob
JOIN	sys.stats			AS st	ON	ob.[object_id]		= st.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.stats_columns	AS sc	ON	st.[stats_id]		= sc.[stats_id]
									AND st.[object_id]		= sc.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.columns			AS co	ON	sc.[column_id]		= co.[column_id]
									AND	sc.[object_id]		= co.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.tables			AS tb	ON	co.[object_id]		= tb.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.schemas			AS sm	ON	tb.[schema_id]		= sm.[schema_id]
WHERE	1=1
AND		st.[user_created]   = 1
GROUP BY
		sm.[name]
,		tb.[name]
,		st.[name]
,		st.[filter_definition]
,		st.[has_filter]
)
SELECT
    CASE @update_type
    WHEN 1
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+');'
    WHEN 2
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+') WITH FULLSCAN;'
    WHEN 3
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+') WITH SAMPLE '+CAST(@sample_pct AS VARCHAR(20))+' PERCENT;'
    WHEN 4
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+') WITH RESAMPLE;'
    END AS [update_stats_ddl]
,   [seq_nmbr]
FROM    t1
;
``` 

>[AZURE.NOTE] `CTAS` is a very powerful command and has the added advantage of being very efficient in its use of transaction log space. 


## Dropping temporary tables

To ensure that your `CREATE TABLE` statements are successful it is important to ensure that the table doesn't already exist in the session. This can be handled with a simple pre-existence check using the pattern below: 

```sql
IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#stats_ddl') IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
	DROP TABLE #stats_ddl
END
```

> [AZURE.NOTE] For coding consistency it is recommended to use this pattern for both tables and temporary tables.

It is also a good idea to use `DROP TABLE` to remove temporary tables when you have finished with them in your code.  

```sql
DROP TABLE #stats_ddl
```

In stored procedure development it is quite common to see the drop commands bundled together at the end of a procedure to ensure these objects are cleaned up.

## Modularizing code

The fact that temporary tables can be seen anywhere in a user session can actually be exploited to help you modularize your application code.

Lets make a working example.

The stored procedure below brings together the examples mentioned above. The code can be used to generate the DDL required to update the statistics on every column in the database:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE    [dbo].[prc_sqldw_update_stats]
(   @update_type    tinyint -- 1 default 2 fullscan 3 sample 4 resample
	,@sample_pct     tinyint
)
AS

IF @update_type NOT IN (1,2,3,4)
BEGIN;
    THROW 151000,'Invalid value for @update_type parameter. Valid range 1 (default), 2 (fullscan), 3 (sample) or 4 (resample).',1;
END;

IF @sample_pct IS NULL
BEGIN;
    SET @sample_pct = 20;
END;

IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#stats_ddl') IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
	DROP TABLE #stats_ddl
END

CREATE TABLE #stats_ddl
WITH
(
	DISTRIBUTION = HASH([seq_nmbr])
)
AS
(
SELECT
		sm.[name]				                                                AS [schema_name]
,		tb.[name]				                                                AS [table_name]
,		st.[name]				                                                AS [stats_name]
,		st.[has_filter]			                                                AS [stats_is_filtered]
,       ROW_NUMBER()
        OVER(ORDER BY (SELECT NULL))                                            AS [seq_nmbr]
,								 QUOTENAME(sm.[name])+'.'+QUOTENAME(tb.[name])  AS [two_part_name]
,		QUOTENAME(DB_NAME())+'.'+QUOTENAME(sm.[name])+'.'+QUOTENAME(tb.[name])  AS [three_part_name]
FROM	sys.objects			AS ob
JOIN	sys.stats			AS st	ON	ob.[object_id]		= st.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.stats_columns	AS sc	ON	st.[stats_id]		= sc.[stats_id]
									AND st.[object_id]		= sc.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.columns			AS co	ON	sc.[column_id]		= co.[column_id]
									AND	sc.[object_id]		= co.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.tables			AS tb	ON	co.[object_id]		= tb.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.schemas			AS sm	ON	tb.[schema_id]		= sm.[schema_id]
WHERE	1=1
AND		st.[user_created]   = 1
GROUP BY
		sm.[name]
,		tb.[name]
,		st.[name]
,		st.[filter_definition]
,		st.[has_filter]
)
SELECT
    CASE @update_type
    WHEN 1
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+');'
    WHEN 2
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+') WITH FULLSCAN;'
    WHEN 3
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+') WITH SAMPLE '+CAST(@sample_pct AS VARCHAR(20))+' PERCENT;'
    WHEN 4
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+') WITH RESAMPLE;'
    END AS [update_stats_ddl]
,   [seq_nmbr]
FROM    t1
;
GO
```

At this stage no action has occured to the table. The procedure simply generated the DDL required to update the statistics and stored that code in a temporary table. 

However, also note that the stored procedure does not include a `DROP TABLE` command at the end. We have however included a pre-existence check into the stored procedure to make the code robust and repeatable; ensuring that our `CTAS` will not fail as a result of a duplicate object existing in the session.

Now for the interesting part!

In SQL Data Warehouse it is possible to use the temporary table outside of the procedure that created it. This is different to SQL Server. In fact the temporary table can be used **anywhere** inside the session.

This can lead to more modular and manageable code. Look at the example below:

```sql
EXEC [dbo].[prc_sqldw_update_stats] @update_type = 1, @sample_pct = NULL;

DECLARE @i INT              = 1
,       @t INT              = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM #stats_ddl)
,       @s NVARCHAR(4000)   = N''

WHILE @i <= @t
BEGIN
    SET @s=(SELECT update_stats_ddl FROM #stats_ddl WHERE seq_nmbr = @i);

    PRINT @s
    EXEC sp_executesql @s
    SET @i+=1;
END

DROP TABLE #stats_ddl;
```

The resulting code is much more compact.

In some cases in-line and multi-statement functions can also be replaced using this technique.

> [AZURE.NOTE] You can also extend this solution. If you only wanted to update a single table for example all you would need to do is just filter the #stats_ddl table

## Temporary table limitations
SQL Data Warehouse does impose a couple of limitations when implementing temporary tables.

The main limitations are:

- Global Temporary Tables are not supported
- Views cannot be created on temporary tables
