You can restore a deleted database during the retenion period for the [SQL Database automated backups](sql-database-automated-backups.md) for your [service tier](sql-database-service-tiers.md). You can use the [Azure portal](sql-database-restore-deleted-database-portal.md), [PowerShell](sql-database-restore-deleted-database-powershell.md) or the [REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt163685.aspx).

## Restoring a Recently Deleted Database

You can restore the deleted database using the same or a different database name to the logical server that contained the original database. For deleted databases, the restore point is fixed to the deletion time of the database.  

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] If you delete an Azure SQL Database server instance, all of its databases are also deleted and cannot be recovered. 

## Restoration time

The time taken to restore a database depends on many factors, including the size of the database, the number of transaction logs, the time point selected, and the amount of activity that needs to be replayed to reconstruct the state at the selected point. For a very large and/or active database the restore may take several hours. Restoring a database always creates a new database on the same server as the original database, so the restored database must be given a new name. The majority of database restorations complete within 12 hours.

## Summary

Automatic backups protect your databases from accidental database deletion. This zero-cost zero-admin solution is available with all SQL databases.
