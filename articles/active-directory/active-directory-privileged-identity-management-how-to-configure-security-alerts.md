# How to configure security alerts in Azure AD Privileged Identity Management

## Security alerts
Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) generates the following alerts, which can be viewed in the Alerts section of the PIM dashboard.

| Alert | Trigger | Recommendation |
| ----- | ------- | -------------- |
| **Permanent activation** | An administrator was permanently assigned to a role, outside of PIM. | Review the new role assignment, and change it to temporary if necessary. |
| **Suspicious activation renewal of privileged roles** | There were too many re-activations of the same role within the time allowed in the settings. | Contact the user to make sure they can activate the role successfully. |
| **Weak authentication is configured for role activation** | There are roles without MFA in the settings. | Consider requiring MFA for activation of all roles. |
| **Redundant administrators** | There are temporary administrators that havenâ€™t activated their roles recently. | Remove role assignments that aren't needed anymore. |
| **Too many global administrators** | There are more global administrators than recommended. | Remove role assignments that aren't needed anymore, or make some of them temporary. |
