# How to perform a security review in Azure AD Privileged Identity Management

Azure Active Directory (AD) Privileged Identity Management simplifies how enterprises manage privileged identities and access to resources in Azure AD as well as other Microsoft online services like Office 365 or Microsoft Intune.  

If you have been assigned to an administrative role, you may be asked by your organization's privileged role administrator to regularly review and confirm that you still need that role for your job. You might get an email that includes a link, or you an go straight to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Follow the steps in this article to perform a self-review of your assigned roles.

If you're a privileged role administrator interested in security reviews, get more details at [How to start a security review](active-directory-privileged-identity-management-how-to-start-security-review.md).

## Add the Privileged Identity Management application

You can use the Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) application in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to perform your review.  If you don't have the Azure AD Privileged Identity Management application on your portal, follow these steps to get started.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), if you haven't already.
2. If your organization has more than one directory, click on your username in the upper right hand corner of the Azure portal, and select the directory where you will you be operating.
3. Select the **New** icon in the left navigation.
4. Select **Security + Identity** from the menu.
5. Select **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.
6. Leave **Pin to dashboard** checked and then click the **Create** button. The Privileged Identity Management application will open.


## Approve or deny access

Access will not be changed until [the review completes](active-directory-privileged-identity-management-how-to-complete-review.md). This process is simply building a checklist for those who would change the access for the role.  Once at least one user has been selected, the **Approve access** and **Deny access** buttons will be enabled.

1. In the PIM application, click **Review administrative access** on the main menu. A list of security reviews will appear.
2. Select the **user(s)** in the list for which you want to change access.
3. Click either  **Approve access** or **Deny access** for the users you have selected.  A notification will appear in the Azure portal main menu and the selected names in review list will disappear (you can get them back by changing the filter option).  Close the **Review Azure AD roles** blade.
